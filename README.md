# Awesome Biology [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

An attempt to collect a curated list of awesome learning resources, research
papers, tools and other resources related to Biology. This is inspired from
several such lists in programming community.

If you want to contribute to this list (please do), [send a pull
request](https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/awesome-biology/compare/), [open an
issue](https://github.com/vivekiitkgp/awesome-biology/issues/new) or contact
through [email](mailto:vivekraiiitkgp@gmail.com). When sending suggestions
please add a short blurb/description about each book that you have personally
read/benefited from. Feel free to debate quality, headings, etc.  irrespective
of any particular field or subject area.

All the resources need not be freely available for download.

For Q&A type of resources that share excellent insight see
